# IWAS – iCafe WiFi Access Service

IWAS is a specialized solution designed to provide seamless WiFi access for iCafe users. It allows users to purchase dedicated WiFi packages via various payment gateways and access high-speed internet on their personal devices.

## 🚀 Overview

The system provides a cloud-based authentication and payment solution for iCafes:

- **Easy Authentication**: Login via Google OAuth for quick access.
- **Multi-tenant Management**: Manage multiple physical locations from a single dashboard.
- **Flexible Payments**: Support for Momo, ZaloPay, VNPay, and VietQR.
- **Session Control**: Real-time monitoring and bandwidth enforcement via FreeRADIUS.
- **iCafe Integration (Future)**: Planned integration with existing PC account systems.

## 🏗️ Technology Stack
